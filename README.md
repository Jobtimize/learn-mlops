# MLOps

A simple MLOps project using sklearn, FastAPI and Pydantic.

## Goal

In a single afternoon, create a minimal MLOps application that is able to:
- Retrieve some toy data (California Housing)
- Train and store a simple ML model
- Serve the model using FastAPI
- Make predictions using an endpoint
- Apply validation to the input data
- Log the steps
- Deploy using Docker

## Next steps:

- Implement unittests
- Setup CI/CD using GitHub Actions
- Add MLFlow
